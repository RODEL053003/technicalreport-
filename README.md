# Ethical Hacking Technical Report
## Client: Acme Corporation
## Date: May 6, 2024
## Prepared by: John Doe and Jane Smith

### Executive Summary:
This report presents the technical findings of the ethical hacking assessment conducted for Acme Corporation. The assessment aimed to identify vulnerabilities within the organization's network infrastructure, applications, and systems. Through various testing methodologies, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, critical and high-risk issues were discovered. This report provides detailed descriptions of these findings, along with actionable recommendations for remediation.

### Vulnerability Summary:
1. **Network Infrastructure:**
   - **Critical:** Unpatched Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) vulnerability (CVE-XXXX-XXXX) on [Server Name], allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
   - **High:** Lack of network segmentation, enabling lateral movement within the network once a system is compromised.

2. **Web Applications:**
   - **Critical:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the authentication process of [Application Name], potentially allowing attackers to bypass authentication and access sensitive data.
   - **High:** Missing input validation in [Application Name], leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

3. **Operating Systems:**
   - **Critical:** Outdated and unpatched versions of Windows Server 2012 on critical servers [Server Names], leaving them susceptible to known exploits.
   - **High:** Insecure default configurations on Linux servers, leading to potential privilege escalation attacks.

4. **Wireless Networks:**
   - **Critical:** Default credentials used for Wi-Fi access points, allowing unauthorized access to the network.
   - **High:** Lack of wireless intrusion detection/prevention systems, making it difficult to detect and respond to wireless attacks.

5. **Social Engineering:**
   - **High:** Employees sharing sensitive information over unencrypted channels, such as email and messaging platforms.
   - **Medium:** Lack of employee awareness regarding phishing attacks, resulting in successful phishing attempts.

### Recommendations:
1. **Network Infrastructure:**
   - Immediately apply patches for the RDP vulnerability and enforce strong authentication mechanisms for remote access.
   - Implement network segmentation to isolate critical assets and limit lateral movement.

2. **Web Applications:**
   - Conduct thorough security assessments and implement input validation mechanisms to mitigate SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
   - Deploy web application firewalls (WAFs) to monitor and filter malicious web traffic.

3. **Operating Systems:**
   - Establish a robust patch management process to ensure timely updates for all servers and endpoints.
   - Harden Linux server configurations by disabling unnecessary services and implementing least privilege principles.

4. **Wireless Networks:**
   - Change default credentials for Wi-Fi access points and enforce strong authentication protocols (e.g., WPA2-Enterprise).
   - Deploy wireless intrusion detection/prevention systems to monitor for unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Social Engineering:**
   - Conduct regular security awareness training sessions for employees to educate them about the risks of sharing sensitive information and how to identify phishing attempts.
   - Implement encryption for communication channels and enforce usage of secure communication tools.

### Conclusion:
The findings of the ethical hacking assessment highlight several critical vulnerabilities and security weaknesses within Acme Corporation's infrastructure and applications. By implementing the recommended remediation measures, Acme Corporation can significantly enhance its security posture and mitigate the risk of cyber threats and data breaches.
